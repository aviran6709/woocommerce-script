# About the App
This project was built with React & nodeJs.
to upload products to woocommerce sites and post about them on Telegram & Facebook 
This tool will help you promote the product on the website and on Facebook and Telegram at once
The tool also collects information from other websites (scrap) to make filling out the form easy and fast
I have used this project in 
woocommerce API
fb by meta

puppeteer
I took the opportunity to edit the default values in the code

In order to run the script edit the serverApi file
